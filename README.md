# Backend for website

**Hi!** :wave:

This repository stores all of the technical gubbins for my personal website: [wpball.com](https://wpball.com)

I used the [Hugo Academic Theme](https://themes.gohugo.io/academic/) developed by [@gcushen](https://github.com/gcushen). The site is hosted by [netlify.com](http://www.netlify.com) and is built automatically any time I edit the markdown files in this repo.
