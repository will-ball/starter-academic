I am a Research Fellow at the University of Aberdeen, working as part of the Networked Data Lab collaborative network. The NDL uses Health Records and other Data to address local and national issues related to health and inequalities.

I am also a PhD Researcher looking at Health Inequalities in the British Nursing workforce as part of Population and Public Health Theme in the School of Health and Social Care at Edinburgh Napier University.

My research interests include Health Inequalities, small-area Deprivation and the Nursing workforce. I conduct quantitative research on Census-derived datasets, linked with administrative data sources.
