On Average, health outcomes are improving around the globe but differences between population groups are growing. Health variation exists between groups based on characteristics like sex, race and socioeconomic factors. Many of these differences are avoidable and unjust. These inequalities in Health present a huge challenge to researchers and policymakers around the world.

This project makes use of individual-level data which has been derived from the Census to explore the presence and extent of health inequalities in the British Nursing workforce. It also aims to determine whether Nurses' health differs from Non-Nurses, and whether there are cross-national differences between Scotland and England & Wales. In addition, the role of area deprivation in these inequalities will be determined.

Nurses are a large occupational group who are relatively socioeconomically homogenous, with characteristics which are potentially protective against health inequalities. Nurses are professionally registered, degree educated and highly health literate. Their homogeneity should theoretically 'control' for potential confounding factors associated with area deprivation measures.
